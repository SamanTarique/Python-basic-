A beginner-friendly Python program that analyzes a given text and provides detailed insights such as total words, characters, sentences, vowels, consonants, and occurrences of a specific word.

---

## üöÄ Features:

- Counts **total words** in the text  
- Calculates **total characters** (excluding spaces and punctuation)  
- Detects **total sentences** based on `.`, `!`, or `?`  
- Counts **vowels** and **consonants**  
- Allows users to **search for a specific word**  
  - Displays how many times the word appears  
  - Shows its **position(s)** in the text  

---

##  How It Works
```bash

1. The program asks the user to input a text.  
2. It then analyzes the text by checking each character and word manually (without using built-in text analysis libraries).  
3. Finally, it prints the overall analysis results and asks the user to enter a word to search within the text.  

```

‚ö†Ô∏è Explanation: The text ‚ÄúPython!Python‚Äù is treated as one word since there‚Äôs no space between the two words.
If you write it as ‚ÄúPython! Python‚Äù (with a space), it will count as two separate words.

## Purpose:

```bash
1. This project helps beginners understand:
2. String manipulation in Python
3. Manual counting using loops and conditions
4. Basic input/output handling
5. How to structure a clean, interactive program
```   


# Contribution:

This project is part of Hacktoberfest 2025 and open for beginner contributions.
Feel free to improve the logic, add more features (like word frequency or paragraph counting), or enhance formatting.
