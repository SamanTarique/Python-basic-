Rock Paper Scissors Game 🪨📄✂️
A simple and fun implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game in Python. Perfect for beginners learning programming!
📖 About the Program
This is a command-line based Rock Paper Scissors game where you play against the computer. The game follows the traditional rules:

Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock

The computer randomly selects its choice, and the winner is determined based on the classic game rules. You can play multiple rounds and the game keeps track of scores!
