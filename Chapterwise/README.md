# Python Programming — Exercises & Notebooks

This repository contains a set of simple Python exercises and Jupyter notebooks used for learning and practicing basic Python programming concepts.

## Contents
- `chapter_1.ipynb` — Notebook for Chapter 1 exercises.
- `chapter_2.ipynb` — Notebook for Chapter 2 exercises.
- `Chapter_3.ipynb` — Notebook for Chapter 3 exercises.
- `chapter_4.ipynb` — Notebook for Chapter 4 exercises.


> Note: Filenames reflect the current workspace. If you add or remove files later, update this README accordingly.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or newer is recommended.

## Quick start

Open the notebooks locally (recommended methods):

- In VS Code: open the folder, then open each `.ipynb` file with the built-in Jupyter support.
- Using Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab:

```powershell
# from the repository root
python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install jupyterlab  # optional, if you want JupyterLab
jupyter lab  # or `jupyter notebook`
```

# Python Programming (practice)

A small collection of personal Python exercises and Jupyter notebooks used for learning.

Status: Practice / Personal — not production-ready.

Files (high level):
- `chapter_1.ipynb`, `chapter_2.ipynb`, `Chapter_3.ipynb`, `chapter_4.ipynb` — notebooks

If you want to contribute elsewhere (recommended):
- Please fork and follow the target project's CONTRIBUTING.md.
- For submitting changes here, keep edits minimal and include a short description of what changed.

No license file is included. Add a `LICENSE` if you want to set reuse terms.

If you'd like, I can:
- create a minimal `CONTRIBUTING.md` for this repo
- generate a `requirements.txt` by scanning notebook imports
- add an MIT `LICENSE` and commit both files

Tell me which of those (if any) you want me to do next.
